# Python Grapher
This project is called Python Grapher.


____

I decided to make this project while I was daydreaming in science class. At the time, our class was learning how to create accurate graphs to represent a data set. This prompted me to think: "I wonder if I could make something that could make a graph for me, without me having to individually plot each data point?" A year ago, I was (and still am) aspiring to become a data scientist, and wanted find a career linked to data analysis. Because of this, I had begun a Python for Data Science course a few months back. At the end of the course, I felt that I should put my newly nurtured skills to practice! Luckily, I was fortunate enough to be told about the Athena Award. Coding 3 projects for 30 hours, utilizing my programming skills, and possibly meeting like-minded individuals along the way? How could I turn that down? Following this message, I signed up and focused my first project on python, data, and graphs.
