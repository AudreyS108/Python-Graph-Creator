# Python Grapher
This project is called Python Grapher.  
It is my first project submission for the Athena Award.  

What it does:
-
This program performs a multitude of functions. They include:
> Creating a variety of graphs (available functions: line graph, scatter plot, histograph, bar chart (numerical))
> Creating a table using the given datapoints inputted by the user, which will appear with the created graph  
> Allowing the user to set x and y labels for their graph  
> Allowing the user to set a relevant title for their graph

I decided to make this project while I was daydreaming in science class. At the time, our class was learning how to create accurate graphs to represent a data set. This prompted me to think: "I wonder if I could make something that could make a graph for me, without me having to individually plot each data point?" A year ago, I was (and still am) aspiring to become a data scientist, and wanted find a career linked to data analysis. Because of this, I had begun a Python for Data Science course a few months back. At the end of the course, I felt that I should put my newly nurtured skills to practice! Luckily, I was fortunate enough to be told about the Athena Award by Hack CLub. Coding 3 projects for 30 hours, utilizing my programming skills, and possibly meeting like-minded individuals along the way? How could I possibly turn that down? After I received the message, I signed up and focused my first project on Python, data, and graphs - which became this project, Python Grapher.

This project was made by using the Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. I used the code editor Jupyter Notebook when making this project.
> Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating graphs with the given datapoints the user inputted.
> Pandas: Used to clean data and format dataset into a table.

Throughout the creation of my project, I was challenged by multiple issues.
> Issue 1: 

By overcoming these challenges, I had developed many skills: 
> 1. When fixing the issue of ___, I had utilized...

Overall, creating this project has led me to enhance many of my coding skills in Python, through solving various challenges.
