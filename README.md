# Python Graph Creator
This project is called Python Graph Creator.  
It is my first project submission for the Athena Award.  
__________________________________________________________
What It Does:
-
This program performs a multitude of functions. They include:
* Creating a variety of graphs (available functions: line graph, scatter plot, histograph, bar chart (numerical))
* Creating a table using the given datapoints inputted by the user, which will appear with the created graph  
* Allowing the user to set x and y labels for their graph  
* Allowing the user to set a relevant title for their graph
__________________________________________________________
How To Operate:
- 
1. Press the green "Code" button. Select "Local" and then "Download ZIP"
![Step1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f273659e-e287-4748-b895-fa7923775d2d)
2. Open the ZIP file, click in "Python-Graph-Creator-main", then "pythongraphcreator"
3. If you use Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:
> Open the file which is of the file type *.ipynb*
> Open Jupyter Notebook and input the following code:
> ```pip install pandas```
> ```pip install matplotlib```
> ```pip install seaborn```
> **(TBC)**
4. If you use VS code or other code editor, follow these steps:
> Open the file which is of the file type *.py*
> **(TBC)**

Personal Project Evaluation and Reflection:
-
I decided to make this project while I was daydreaming in science class. At the time, our class was learning how to create accurate graphs to represent a data set. This prompted me to think: "I wonder if I could make something that could make a graph for me, without me having to individually plot each data point?" A year ago, I was (and still am) aspiring to become a data scientist, and wanted find a career linked to data analysis. Because of this, I had begun a Python for Data Science course a few months back. At the end of the course, I felt that I should put my newly nurtured skills to practice! Luckily, I was fortunate enough to be told about the Athena Award by Hack CLub. Coding 3 projects for 30 hours, utilizing my programming skills, and possibly meeting like-minded individuals along the way? How could I possibly turn that down? After I received the message, I signed up and focused my first project on Python, data, and graphs - which became this project, Python Graph Creator.
__________________________________________________________
This project was made by using the Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas. I used the code editor Jupyter Notebook when making this project.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: Used for creating graphs with the given datapoints the user inputted.
* Pandas: Used to clean data and format dataset into a table.

Throughout the creation of my project, I was challenged by multiple issues.
* Issue 1: 

By overcoming these challenges, I had developed many skills: 
1. When fixing the issue of ___, I had utilized...
2. Text
3. Text

Overall, creating this project has led me to enhance many of my coding skills in Python, through solving various challenges.
